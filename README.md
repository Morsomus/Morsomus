# About Me

I am a full-time **Software Developer** working with **IoT** based embedded systems.

### Technical Focus

My expertise lies in embedded systems, specifically working with **ESP32 (C++/Matter)** and **STM32** platforms. I have a background in developing desktop and Linux-based touch-screen applications using **Qt and QML**.

In addition to hardware-level coding, I manage the full stack which includes mobile development with **React Native and Flutter**, as well as building backends using **C, C++, PHP, Node.js, and Python**. I also have experience in server infrastructure, focusing in maintaining **Linux-based environments** and mail servers.

Beyond my full-time job, I am the founder of a small side business, **Protopax**, where I provide specialized services in drone thermal imaging analytics, 3D printing, 3D modeling with Blender, and custom IT solutions.

### Personal Interests

Outside of professional grind, I am a family man with some technical and physical hobbies. Which includes building gaming PCs and custom IoT devices from components. I enjoy the constant learning curve that comes with modern engineering.

For balance between static job and healthy life, I like spending time at the gym.
